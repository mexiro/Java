# Merge Multiple text files to one
### _Working with files in java_

This java Class merges multiple text files to one

- Checks if there are files in the input directory
- Renames them one by one to .txt extension (presumably files contain text) but have no extension
- âœ¨with Magic reads files and merges them in one single text file.
