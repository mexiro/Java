# JAVA - Codes and samples
## _Personal Java projects Erion Maxhari_
##### Java mini projects, classes, deployments, and code samples mainly for work and fund but with the purpose of learning the beautiful Java language.

### 1. Why?
I am currently working in a bank and I love big data, therefore I am finishing studies in MSc Computer Science and Big Data.
Why Java?
- After VB for applications, a bit of front-end html-CSS, Java was a major upgrade in my programming knowledge or future career. 
- Java it’s a robust language, and the best one for enterprise applications (due to my work this is the center of my attention)
- ✨Java is beautiful & magic ✨

### 2. List of code and projects 
Current projects can be reused, and I hope it will help you. If you need any help please write me at emaxhari@gmail.com 

Please understand that my JAVA learning path is still at begining phase. I have around 3-4 month learing in university and then another 3-4 month practicing with those projects below. So accept flaws and issues in the code. 

| Folder/project | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| ParsingfilesIV | IV is a VISA interchange file. It's a generated in a fixed length text format, but different lines have different field lengths. Rather a complex project for me which it took around 1 month to finetune. It reads a very large text file with hundred thousands of rows, clasifies those rows and writes some of the transactions pos, atm, refund etc with codes like TC05,TC06, etc in a csv file. Prety good |
| DergoSMS | A java code which once executed, retrieves list of customers from an access database, sends SMS  via an HTTP app with different body to mobile phone numbers retrieved from the database and then updates the status in this databese if SMS is delivered or not and their status. Project was not so complex but it required a couple of weeks to finish because of finetuning mostly |
| Mergeallfiles | it is basically a simple java class, that reads all text files in one folder and merges them all in one file  |
| University database | While studying in the first semester of CS Java class I delivered a projects|
| JavaBar | Another University project to manage (simple) BAR and Coffee shop inventory system|
